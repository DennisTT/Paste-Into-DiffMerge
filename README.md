Paste-Into-DiffMerge
====================

Mac Automator UI to allow pasting into DiffMerge.

DiffMerge (http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/) is a powerful diff/merge tool that shows intra-line changes.  However, it requires text to be in existing files before they can be opened.

This is an Automator Application which takes in two text inputs, creates appropriate temporary files, and passes them into DiffMerge.

You can open the .app file in Automator to edit the workflow.
